Rolling Dice Simulation
1) 1 turn: player and computer each get 1 turn
- we ask tuser to press enter in order to roll dice
- two numbers between 1-6 will be randomly generated 
- These two numbers will be added
- computer turn will result in two seperate randomly generated numbers as well
- These numbers will also be between 1-6 and be added 
- The winner is whoever got the bigger sum.
2) Same as 1) but we add a "do you want to play again?"
